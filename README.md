## **Quick Start**

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js 16+
- Rust 1.60+
- Solana CLI 1.18.17
- Anchor Framework 0.30.0

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[YOUR-USERNAME]/invoice-financing.git
   cd invoice-financing
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the smart contract**
   ```bash
   anchor build
   ```

4. **Run the frontend**
   ```bash
   # Open frontend/index.html in your browser
   # Or serve with a local server:
   npx serve frontend
   ```

### **Deployment**

1. **Configure Solana for devnet**
   ```bash
   solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com
   solana airdrop 2
   ```

2. **Deploy smart contract**
   ```bash
   anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet
   # Or use: solana program deploy target/deploy/invoice_financing.so
   ```

3. **Update frontend with deployed Program ID**
   ```javascript
   // In frontend/index.html, update:
   const PROGRAM_ID = new solanaWeb3.PublicKey("YOUR_DEPLOYED_PROGRAM_ID");
   ```

## **Key Features & Innovation**

### **Advanced Risk Engine**
```rust
// Multi-factor risk assessment
- Amount-based risk (higher amounts = higher risk)
- Duration-based risk (shorter terms = higher risk)  
- Credit scoring simulation (mock business credit)
- Industry risk factors
- Historical payment analysis
```

### **Dynamic Insurance Coverage**
- **Low Risk (0-20)**: 90% coverage
- **Medium Risk (21-35)**: 80% coverage  
- **High Risk (36-50)**: 70% coverage
- **Very High Risk (51+)**: 60% coverage

### **Yield Optimization**
- Base yield: 5% APR
- Risk premium: up to 10% additional APR
- Late fees: 0.05% per day
- Insurance pool yields for liquidity providers

## **Smart Contract Functions**

| Function | Description | Parameters |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| `initialize` | Initialize global state | `authority`, `usdc_mint` |

| `fund_invoice` | Investor funds invoice | `amount` |
| `repay_invoice` | Business repays funded invoice | `repayment_amount` |
| `claim_insurance` | Investor claims default insurance | - |

## **Business Model**
